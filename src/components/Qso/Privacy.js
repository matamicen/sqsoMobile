audios, likes, comments, your biography, First Name, Last Name, Street, ZipCode and your
callsign as a ham radio operator), and post pages (such as QSOs, Listen, Post and your

Data Storage
{"\n\n"}
</Text>

SuperQSO uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Amazon, for hardware,
software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run SuperQSO. We maintain
two types of logs: server logs and event logs. By using the Services, you authorize SuperQSO to
transfer, store, and use your information in United States, and any other country where we
operate.

<Text style={{fontWeight: "bold",  fontSize: 16}}> 
Third-Party Embeds
{"\n\n"}
</Text>
Some of the content that you see displayed on SuperQSO is not hosted by SuperQSO. These “embeds” are hosted by a third-party and embedded in a SuperQSO page, so that it appears to be part of that page. For example: YouTube or Vimeo videos, Imgur or Giphy gifs, SoundCloud audio files, Twitter tweets, GitHub code snippets, or Scribd documents that appear within a SuperQSO post. These files send data to the hosted site just as if you were visiting that site directly (for example, when you load a SuperQSO post page with a YouTube video embedded in it, that video appears because of a pointer to files hosted by YouTube, and in turn YouTube receives data about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch).
SuperQSO doesn’t control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they ultimately do with it. So, third-party embeds on SuperQSO are not covered by this Privacy Policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service (so, when you watch a YouTube video embedded in a SuperQSO post, the use of data about your interactions with the video would be covered by YouTube’s privacy policy).
Some embeds may ask you for personal information, such as submitting your email address, through a form linked to from a SuperQSO post. We do our best to keep bad actors off of SuperQSO. However, if you choose to submit your information to a third party this way, we don’t know what they may do with it. As explained above, their actions are not covered by this Privacy Policy. So, please be careful when you see embedded forms on SuperQSO asking for your email address or any other personal information. Make sure you understand who you are submitting your information to and what they say they plan to do with it. We suggest that you do not submit your email address or other personal information to any third-party through an embedded form.
When posting on SuperQSO, you may not embed a form that allows submission of personal information by users. You must link offsite to a page that allows such submissions by users, and that page’s appearance must be distinct enough from SuperQSO to ensure it does not cause confusion among users over to whom they are submitting personal information. Failure to do so may lead SuperQSO to disable the post or take other action to limit or disable your account.

<Text style={{fontWeight: "bold",  fontSize: 16}}> 
Tracking & Cookies
{"\n\n"}
</Text>

Services. We use them in various ways, for example to log you in, remember your preferences
(such as default language), evaluate email effectiveness, allow our paywall and meter to function,
and personalize content and other services. Without cookies, our metered paywall would not
work, so they are necessary to SuperQSO’s basic functionality.
SuperQSO saves data about the URLs you Save to SuperQSO, but we do not otherwise track
your visits or activities off SuperQSO Services. We track your interactions within the SuperQSO
Services (which encompasses SuperQSO.com, custom domains hosted by SuperQSO, and your
interactions with our mobile application).

place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by SuperQSO
only and not the use of cookies by third parties.
